Docker containers allow you to test and distribute simple and complex pipelines.
You can write pipelines with different dependencies without the need to install
them on your machine. Users can then pull your pipelines or tools and
start using them without having to worry about dependencies or adventurous
installation instructions. If your tool or pipeline can run on a HPC cluster, you
can also deploy them as Singularity images, a more secure variant of docker containers

The workshop will introduce you to Docker Containers and Singularity Images. You
will learn how to create, run, and distribute them using typical biological
tasks as examples. Participants are invited to bring their own pipelines they
wish to "Dockerize" in the last part of the workshop.
