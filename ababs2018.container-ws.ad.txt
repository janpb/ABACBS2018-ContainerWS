Overview

Docker containers allow you to test and distribute simple and complex pipelines.
You can write pipelines with different dependencies without the need to install
them on your machine. Users can then pull your pipelines or tools and
start using them without having to worry about dependencies or adventurous
installation instructions. If your tool or pipeline can run on a HPC cluster, you
can also deploy them as Singularity images, a more secure variant of docker containers

The workshop will introduce you to Docker Containers and Singularity Images. You
will learn how to create, run, and distribute them using typical biological
tasks as examples. Participants are invited to bring their own pipelines they
wish to "Dockerize" in the last part of the workshop.

Target Audience

You have written an amazing analysis pipeline which depends on your own and
external libraries. You incorporated external software for specific
steps and the  pipeline requires the newest version of your favorite
programming language due to THIS feature. You spent a day to write and test the
installation instructions on your own machine. A few days later, you discover
that only few users read the README, several complain about weird dependencies,
others cannot install dependencies due to different reasons. You consider
to skip the Reviewer comments and discover that your cluster got updated and you
have to fix all dependencies for your own pipelines as well as for external
software.

If any of these scenarios sounds familiar to you, this could be your workshop.

What to bring

Laptop with administrative privileges. Installed Docker [0] and Singularity [1]
for your OS. Assuming: experience with the command-line of your OS (the
workshop will use examples using the Unix command-line), familiarity with git
and ssh.
