You have written an amazing analysis pipeline which depends on your own and
external libraries. In addition, you incorporated external tools for specific
steps. Lastly, the pipeline requires the newest version of your favorite
programming language. You spent a day to write and test the installation
instructions on your own machine. A few days later, you figure that only few
users read the README, several complain about weird dependencies, and numerous
cannot install dependencies due to different reasons. You wish you haven't read
the comments from your reviewers.

Docker containers allow you to test and distribute simple and complex pipelines.
You can write pipelines with different dependencies without the need to install
them on your machine. Analogous, users can pull your pipelines or tools and
start using them without having to worry about dependencies or adventurous
installation instructions. If your tool or pipeline can run on a cluster, you
can deploy them as Singularity images.

The workshop will introduce you to Docker Containers and Singularity Images. You
will learn how to create, run, and distribute them using typical biological
tasks as examples. Participants are invited to bring their own pipelines they
can
